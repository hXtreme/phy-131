# Simulated Newton's Second Law Lab

__Harsh Parekh__

## Introduction
We perform an experiment to verify Newton's second law of motion.
```
    F = ma
```
To do this we perform two types of experiments:

1. Keeping everyting else constant, change Force (F).
2. Keeping everything else constant, change mass (m).

## Methods
__Materials:__  

1. Rocket with adjustable force ( 10N, 20N, 40N ).
2. Balls of various mass ( 1kg, 2kg, 4kg ).

__Setup__  

1. Lay the mass on a friction-less surface and attach a rocket to it.
2. Ignite the rocket and measure and note the velocity at various times.

## Data Analysis/Graphs
_( See attached spreadsheet "./Week 2/Second Law.ods" )_

## Discussion of results
We see that our observed data fits the model very well with the predictions made by 
Newton's second law of motion, with R^2 value extremely close to one. 
We don't see or expect any discrepancies or errors in data gathering.

## Conclusion
The experiment was very successful, and we have with some certainty verified Newton's second law of motion.
